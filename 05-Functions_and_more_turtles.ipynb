    "In computer programming, a function acts a little bit similar to functions in math and also a little bit different. Some things which are the **same** are\n",
    "1. Functions take in some number of \"parameters\". In the math function above, we see one parameter, \"$x$\".\n",
    "2. Functions produce some result. This is also known as a \"return value\". In the math function above, the result is whatever you get out when you do the arithmetic in the formula.\n",
    "3. Functions can be \"composed\" with other functions. You might have seen something like $f(g(x))$ in math; we can do that in CS as well. It is a **powerful** concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things which are **different** in computer science are \n",
    "1. Functions can take parameters which are not numbers, or no parameters at all.\n",
    "2. Functions can return things that are not numbers, or nothing at all.\n",
    "3. Functions can do things other than produce a return value. e.g. print to the screen, draw a picture, communicate over the network.\n",
    "4. Functions do not have to produce the same return value when you give it the same parameters. ex: `random()` takes no parameters at all, and gives different return values all the time. (However, it is good practice to limit this sort of behavior.)\n"
