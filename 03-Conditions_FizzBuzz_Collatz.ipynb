    "Ok, today we are going to start off by learning a few more Python language constructs. These are a little different what we have learned so far. So far, what we have written looks a lot like a recipe in a cookbook: There is a first, second, third step, etc. You just go from one thing to the next --- there aren't any choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't make for a very interesting program.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting program will do things like ask questions and interact with its environment. There are _choices_ to be made. You do this sort of thing every day: You go to the cafeteria and see what's there. If it is good enough, you eat. Otherwise you have make another decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several different constructions that are useful for making choices. The simplest is the `if` statement. The basic `if` statement needs two things\n",
    "* a condition, which is either true of false\n",
    "* code to run if the condition is _true_\n",
    "For example, suppose that we were curious to learn if the word \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" was longer than \"pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis\". (pretend that you can't just see the length) We could write\n",
    "```\n",
    "supercali = \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"\n",
    "pneumono  = \"pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis\"\n",

    "By the way, notice that the `print` statement is **indented**. This is how Python tells which part of your code is conditional on the `if`. We call that indented a _code block_. (Other languages use things like curly braces `{}` to do the same thing, but even then you expected to indent as a matter of proper style.)\n",

    "Now, let's try to enhance our word length code. We want to write some code that reads in two words and compares them to see which one is longer, or if they have the same length.
